About:
This is one of my first open source projects and it seems like it is a good fit for open source. Voidrunner is simply my umbrella name for projects that skate the edge of what hasn't been done yet (the void or preknown). That's a bit heavy for some python scripting, and the ascii here could probably be improved, but hey everyone does it how they like it, as do I.

Please see the wiki to discuss or introduce new features.
