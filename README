About:
This is one of my first open source projects and it seems like it is a good fit for open source. Voidrunner is simply my umbrella name for projects that skate the edge of what hasn't been done yet (the void or preknown). That's a bit heavy for some python scripting, and the ascii here could probably be improved, but hey everyone does it how they like it, as do I.

motivation:
I was psyched about the MIDI Remote Script that came with Maschine, but there is more to be 
done towards performance with a single controller for both software at once. For me, the ideal 
functionality would be for this controller script to provide enough functionality and on screen 
info about Live that one would have to look at the screen as little as possible while performing.
I have a blogspot at http://voidrunner.com, where I get into what I have been doing.


status:
The VoidMaschine is using the features of the NI-provided MIDI Control Script as base line 
acceptance criteria. Starting from scratch, I have filled in most of this functionality. 
I am planning new features for it as well. I have set up session navigation, transport controls, 
session clip launching (but not displaying), and the beginning of a screen display functionality.
I am currently working on extending the _Framework.ButtonElement class to make clip launch status show 
via blinking/solid/off.  Currently it is only solid/on when a clip is playing, otherwise blank.

Please see the wiki to discuss or introduce new features.
